IHRL, rooted in the inherent dignity of individuals, as articulated in Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, treats the right to life as a near-absolute entitlement, permitting deprivations only in narrowly defined circumstances such as lawful self-defense or executions for serious crimes after due process. IHRL assumes stable governance and state accountability, emphasizing prevention through legal remedies and investigations. In contrast, IHL, grounded in the 1949 Geneva Conventions, pragmatically acknowledges that &ldquo;wars are inevitable&rdquo; and seeks to humanize conflict by regulating violence, allowing the lawful killing of combatants while mandating protections for civilians and non-combatants</span><span class="c1">. This essay argues that abolishing IHL would severely undermine the right to life in wartime, where IHRL&rsquo;s peacetime-oriented mechanisms falter, by examining IHL&rsquo;s legal requirements for application and its complementary role with IHRL, supported by scholarly evidence and historical patterns.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Central to understanding IHL&#39;s irreplaceable value is grasping its legal requirements for application, which are precise and automatically triggered by the existence of an armed conflict, ensuring immediate, context-specific protections that IHRL cannot provide. An armed conflict can be an International Armed Conflict (IAC) or a Non-International Armed Conflict (NIAC); these are the two categories that govern the scope and applicability of IHL. IAC is a situation where two or more states are engaged in hostilities, necessitating the rules designed to minimize suffering in situations of war. NIAC refers to situations of internal protracted violence between government forces and organized non-state groups or among such groups, such as civil wars or insurgency, where certain IHL rules apply due to the scale and intensity of the conflict. While not all IHL rules automatically apply, those concerning the protection of civilians and the humane treatment of prisoners of war do apply, reflecting a recognition that even internal conflicts can generate grave humanitarian concerns. IHL&rsquo;s temporal scope begins with the first act of conflict and ends at hostilities&rsquo; cessation or repatriation of prisoners, while its geographical scope covers belligerent territories and occupied areas, ensuring rules like distinction (separating combatants from civilians) and proportionality (balancing military advantage against civilian harm) apply universally (Wei&szlig; &amp; Zimmermann, 2005, p.102). Rooted in customary international law, these requirements provide a framework which is not provided by IHRL, which lacks the specific rules for warfare. These customary rules, binding even non-ratifying states, offer a critical framework during armed conflict.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As necessitated by these legal triggers, IHL&rsquo;s distinct approach does not weaken the right to life but adapts it to the realities of war, where IHRL&rsquo;s absolute prohibitions are impractical. The cornerstone of IHL is that parties to a conflict must distinguish between combatants and civilians. Attacks may only be directed against combatants, any failure to do so constitutes a grave violation. This requirement is directly linked to the right to life and ensures that civilians cannot be intentionally targeted. However, IHL permits targeting combatants if it serves a &ldquo;definite military advantage,&rdquo; but mandates protections for civilians, prohibiting indiscriminate attacks or unnecessary suffering, as codified in the Hague Regulations and Geneva Conventions. Without IHL, conflicts could escalate into total war, as historical examples demonstrate; World War II saw Nazi Germany comply with prisoner-of-war protections against Western Allies but commit atrocities against the Soviet Union, where mutual ratification was absent (Morrow, 2007, p.561-562). Empirical studies show that IHL&rsquo;s reciprocity mechanisms, strengthened by joint treaty ratification, enhance compliance, particularly on issues like chemical weapons bans, which have &ldquo;the greatest compliance&rdquo; due to mutual deterrence (Morrow, 2007). &nbsp;For instance, the 1925 Geneva Protocol&rsquo;s success in limiting chemical weapon use illustrates IHL&rsquo;s capacity to save lives through enforceable norms, a specific provision that IHRL lacks in conflict zones. Also, domestic courts increasingly cite IHRL alongside IHL, interpreting constitutions in harmony with both to bolster protections, as cumulative references in national laws show growing integration (Sandholtz, 2015, p.601-602, 608-609). Abolishing IHL would strip away this layered defense, leaving IHRL&rsquo;s broad principles, designed for stable governance, to confront war&#39;s anarchy alone, potentially increasing civilian deaths.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">IHL&rsquo;s legal requirements also enable accountability mechanisms that IHRL alone cannot sustain in wartime. The two bodies are not in competition but mutually reinforcing, IHL offers provisions that maximize the right to life&#39;s security by addressing gaps where human rights norms are insufficiently tailored to conflict dynamics. IHL&rsquo;s conflict-specific rules, like prohibiting attacks on civilian objects, complement IHRL&rsquo;s absolute bans on arbitrary killings, maximizing safeguards (Fortin, 2002, p.303). This synergy is evident in jurisprudence from bodies like the International Court of Justice, which affirms IHL&#39;s application without negating IHRL, ensuring comprehensive coverage (Fortin, 2002, p.301-303). For example, in non-international conflicts, where IHRL primarily binds states, IHL extends obligations to non-state actors, preventing legal vacuums that could endanger lives. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Critics argue IHL normalizes violence by permitting combatant deaths, potentially undermining IHRL&rsquo;s absolutes, but this argument overlooks how IHL&rsquo;s legal requirements prevent escalation beyond necessity, saving more lives overall. In debates on nuclear threats or asymmetric warfare, IHL restricts lethal force against legitimate targets only when &quot;actually necessary,&quot; aligning with IHRL&#39;s proportionality to avoid superfluous injury. Historical compliance patterns illustrate IHL&#39;s success in fostering restraint, even among adversaries. In response to critiques of modern asymmetric battles where non-state actors exploit ambiguities, scholars argue that such exploitation highlights enforcement gaps rather than inherent flaws in IHL (Fortin, 2002, p.301-303). Realistic critiques like &ldquo;power trumps law&rdquo; are valid, but empirical patterns like the observed &nbsp;higher compliance in democracies with ratified treaties show IHL&#39;s deterrent effect. Moreover, without IHL, IHRL&#39;s enforcement in war zones, especially when reliant on domestic courts and media, would collapse, as non-democracies resist international scrutiny. Integration through domestic rulings, where judges cite IHRL treaties alongside IHL, enhances legitimacy and authority, mitigating political risks in rulings (Sandholtz, 2015, p.608-609). Recent calls for going &quot;beyond compliance&quot; acknowledge IHL&#39;s limits but affirm it as essential until full civilian protection is achieved. Abolition would not end wars but remove the ethical compass guiding conduct, as IHL&#39;s principles of distinction and humanity remain vital amid rising violations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In conclusion, IHL&rsquo;s legal requirements, rooted in the Geneva Conventions&rsquo; automatic application in IACs and NIACs, provide a critical framework for securing the right to life in contexts where IHRL&rsquo;s absolutes are impractical. Complementing IHRL, IHL&rsquo;s principles of distinction, proportionality, and humane treatment mitigate war&rsquo;s brutality, as evidenced by compliance patterns and judicial integration. IHL offers a crucial, though imperfect, shield in securing the right to life during armed conflict, but its limitations in fully protecting civilians demonstrate a need for ongoing refinement and a recognition that it operates within a framework of strategic, rather than absolute protection. The notion that society might fare better without IHL overlooks its indispensable role in curbing the excesses of armed conflict, where IHRL&#39;s peacetime-oriented mechanisms often falter. IHL&#39;s core objective is to humanize war by imposing limits on means and methods. Abolishing IHL would dismantle these safeguards, exposing lives to unregulated violence, as conflicts from Ukraine to Gaza demonstrate the need for its continued reinforcement.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">References</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Wei&szlig;, N., &amp; Zimmermann, A.
