Johnson (LBJ) (1963&ndash;1969) and Richard M. Nixon (1969&ndash;1974) created a pivotal period in American judicial history, transitioning from a relatively routine confirmation process that was swift and non-controversial to one that is highly politicized and contentious. These processes were influenced by ideological differences, political ambitions and partisan Senate politics. And, set a precedent for most of the recent high-stakes confirmation battles. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>There are many similarities between the confirmation processes under LBJ and Nixon, reflecting an increased politicization of the Supreme Court appointments. These similarities highlight the overlapping challenges faced by both administrations, and also the strategic maneuvers devised by those administrations to influence the Court&#39;s direction during this period. LBJ and Nixon used Supreme Court appointments to advance their political strategies and i</span><span>deological goals to shape the Court. B</span><span class="c1">oth presidents prioritized nominees who aligned with their ideological vision for the Supreme Court, aiming to cement their political legacies through judicial appointments. LBJ sought to perpetuate the Warren Court&rsquo;s liberal activism, which had produced landmark decisions like Brown v. Board of Education (1954), Miranda v. Arizona (1966) and Gideon v. Wainwright (1963), advancing civil rights and individual protections (Bobelian, 2018). His nominations of Fortas (1965, 1968) and Thurgood Marshall (1967) reflected this commitment to liberalism. Implementing a similar political strategy, albeit conversely, Nixon campaigned on a promise to appoint &ldquo;strict constructionists&rdquo; who would counter the Warren Court&rsquo;s perceived judicial overreach, appealing to conservative voters concerned about crime and social unrest. His appointments of Warren Burger (1969), Harry Blackmun (1970), Lewis Powell (1971), and William Rehnquist (1971) aimed to shift the Court toward a more conservative jurisprudence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The United States Senate emerged as a robust check on presidential power, breaking with the tradition of deference to the executive branch during both administrations. LBJ and Nixon faced significant Senate resistance, reflecting the increased willingness of senators to challenge presidential nominees on ideological and political grounds. LBJ&rsquo;s 1968 nomination of Fortas for Chief Justice encountered a historic filibuster led by senators Strom Thurmond and Robert Griffin, who opposed </span><span>Fortas&rsquo;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;liberalism and close ties to LBJ (Bobelian, 2018). Similarly, Nixon&rsquo;s nominations of Haynsworth and Carswell were rejected by the Senate based on ethical concerns. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The growing involvement of external actors like advocacy groups and the media was another common occurrence during the confirmation process under both administrations. Conservative groups and the press scrutinized Fortas&rsquo;s record and personal ties to LBJ, amplifying accusations of cronyism and ethical lapses (Bobelian, 2018). Similarly, NAACP and AFL-CIO mobilized against Nixon&rsquo;s nominees Haynsworth and Carswell, whose judicial records on civil rights and labor issues drew criticism. The media&rsquo;s role in covering these confirmation battles transformed the nominees into public figures, subjecting them to unprecedented scrutiny and fueled further politicization of the process.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The Supreme Court&rsquo;s long-term influence on American law and society makes Court appointments critical to the legacy of an American president. LBJ aimed to safeguard his Great Society programs and civil rights achievements through liberal justices who would uphold the Warren Court&rsquo;s precedents (Bobelian, 2018). Nixon, leveraging his &ldquo;Southern Strategy&rdquo; to appeal to conservative Southern voters, sought to fulfill his campaign promise of restoring &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; by appointing justices who would curb judicial activism. This shared emphasis on legacy elevated the strategic importance of judicial appointments in both administrations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite these similarities, the Court&rsquo;s nomination processes also show stark differences between the two administrations in several critical aspects, including political context, nominee selection strategies, opposition tactics, and outcomes. These differences in the confirmation processes highlight the unique challenges each president faced and their distinct approaches to navigating and winning the confirmation process. The respective political environments in which LBJ and Nixon operated also shaped their nomination strategies and outcomes. In 1968, LBJ worked with a Democratic-majority Senate with approximately 2:1 majority, which theoretically gave him an advantage in securing confirmations (NPR, 2016). However, after announcing in March 1968 that he would not seek re-election, his lame-duck status weakened his political leverage. His opponents argued that a departing president should not fill a critical vacancy like Chief Justice (Bobelian, 2018). In contrast, Nixon faced a Democratic-majority Senate, 57&ndash;43 in 1969, that required him to navigate a relatively hostile political environment. His post-election mandate in 1969 initially bolstered his efforts, but Democratic control of the Senate and moderate Republican defections complicated his nominations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">LBJ and Nixon adopted different approaches to selecting their nominees for the Court. LBJ prioritized personal loyalty and proven liberalism, often choosing Washington insiders with close ties to his administration. Patterns in his selection criteria are notable in the nominations of Fortas, a longtime advisor, in 1965 and again in 1968, and Homer Thornberry, a loyal Texas associate, in 1968. Nixon, by contrast, focused on ideological alignment and regional appeal, particularly through his &ldquo;Southern Strategy&rdquo; to court Southern voters. His nominations of Southern judges like Haynsworth and Carswell aimed to consolidate conservative support, but their weaker qualifications and controversial records led to Senate rejections (Bobelian, 2018). Nixon&rsquo;s selection of later nominees, Blackmun and Powell, reflected a big shift toward candidates with stronger credentials to avoid further defeats.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tactics used by opponents to block nominees varied significantly between the two administrations. Under LBJ, opposition to Fortas&rsquo;s 1968 Chief Justice nomination was marked by theatrical and personal attacks. Senator Strom Thurmond hit Fortas&rsquo;s reputation over obscenity rulings and aggressively questioned his role in liberal Warren Court decisions like Mallory v. United States (1957) (Bobelian, 2018). In contrast, opposition to Nixon&rsquo;s nominees relied on detailed scrutiny of their judicial records and ethical conduct. Haynsworth was criticized for conflicts of interest in labor and civil rights cases, while Carswell faced rejection due to his mediocre qualifications and past support for segregation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Supreme Court confirmation outcomes under LBJ and Nixon also differed in their success rates and long-term impact. LBJ achieved early successes with the confirmations of Fortas as Associate Justice in 1965 and Thurgood Marshall in 1967, both of whom faced minimal or manageable opposition (Bobelian, 2018). However, his 1968 attempt to elevate Fortas to Chief Justice and appoint Thornberry failed due to the filibuster, marking a significant defeat that left Chief Justice Earl Warren in place until Nixon&rsquo;s presidency (NPR, 2016). Nixon, despite suffering two rare Senate rejections with Haynsworth and Carswell, ultimately secured four confirmations. His adaptability in pivoting to stronger nominees after setbacks contributed to his greater overall success, and enabled him to reshape the Court&rsquo;s ideological balance. He demonstrated an effective strategic adaptability compared to LBJ, whose approach was more rigid. LBJ relied on his political clout and expected historical precedents of quick confirmations, underestimating the filibuster and conservative backlash against Fortas (Bobelian, 2018). When the nomination failed, LBJ had no fallback plan, resulting in a lost opportunity to influence the Court. Nixon, however, learned from early defeats. After the rejections of Haynsworth and Carswell, he nominated Blackmun and Powell, candidates with stronger credentials who faced lesser opposition and were confirmed. This flexibility allowed Nixon to shift the Court rightward as part of his legacy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Chief Justice Earl Warren&rsquo;s contingent resignation in June 1968, announced with the condition that he would retire once his successor was confirmed, was a strategic attempt to ensure that LBJ could appoint a liberal successor to preserve the Warren Court&rsquo;s legacy of progressive jurisprudence. This announcement by Justice Warren was followed by failed nominations, a financial scandal, and passing up this opportunity to appoint the Chief Justice to Nixon led to appointments that profoundly altered the Court&rsquo;s trajectory shifting from liberal activism to a more conservative orientation and reshaping its institutional norms. LBJ nominated Associate Justice Abe Fortas to replace Earl Warren as Chief Justice, and nominated Homer Thornberry to fill Fortas&rsquo;s associate justice seat, aiming to lock in the Warren Court&rsquo;s liberalism (Bobelian, 2018). However, the nominations faced fierce opposition from a coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats, driven by ideological backlash, allegations of cronyism, LBJ&rsquo;s lame duck status, and the filibuster. The Senate mounted the first-ever filibuster against a Supreme Court nominee, led by senators Strom Thurmond and Robert Griffin. Thurmond&rsquo;s aggressive tactics turned the hearings into a spectacle. The 1968 filibuster against Fortas introduced a powerful tool to delay or block Supreme Court nominees, requiring 67 votes to end debate in that era., but a cloture vote yielded only 45&ndash;43 in favor, forcing LBJ to withdraw both Fortas&rsquo;s and Thornberry&rsquo;s nominations in October 1968 (NPR, 2016). As a result, Warren agreed to remain as the Chief Justice until the next administration, delaying his retirement and handing the opportunity to shape the Court to Nixon, who assumed the presidency in January 1969 (Bobelian, 2018).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Had Fortas been confirmed as Chief Justice, the Supreme Court might have sustained its liberal trajectory for another decade, reinforcing Warren Court precedents on civil rights, voting rights, and individual liberties (Bobelian, 2018). Instead, Chief Justice Warren&rsquo;s retirement during the Nixon administration made way for the Burger Court consisting of Burger, Blackmun, Powell, and Rehnquist. Driven by a campaign promise to appoint conservative justices, Nixon nominated Burger, a conservative appellate judge, to replace Warren as Chief Justice. He was confirmed swiftly with minimal opposition (Bobelian, 2018). Harry Blackmun (1970), a midwestern judge, was also nominated by Nixon and confirmed unanimously, firmly establishing his conservative ideology. Later, he nominated Lewis Powell and William Rehnquist (1971) to replace retiring Justices Hugo Black and John Marshall Harlan II. Powell and Rehnquist were confirmed with 89&ndash;1 and 68&ndash;26 votes, respectively. Burger Court, which moderated or reversed many Warren Court precedents, successfully implemented an ideological shift from liberalism to conservative principles adopting a more restrained approach, with significant impacts on key areas of law. For example, Milliken v. Bradley (1974) limited busing remedies for school desegregation, slowing progress on racial integration (Bobelian, 2018). Burger and Rehnquist advocated for originalism and textualism, challenging the Warren Court&rsquo;s expansive interpretations of the Constitution. Rehnquist&rsquo;s appointment was particularly transformative, as Chief Justice from 1986 to 2005, he led the Rehnquist Court, advancing conservative principles in cases like United States v. Lopez (1995), which restricted federal power under the Commerce Clause, and laid the foundation for the conservative dominance of the Roberts Court (Bobelian, 2018). This shift set the stage for the conservative legal movement&rsquo;s eventual dominance under the Rehnquist and Roberts Courts, fundamentally altering the Court&rsquo;s role in American society.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The confirmation battles under LBJ and Nixon established precedents and tactics that profoundly shaped some of the recent Supreme Court confirmation proceedings, transforming them into high-stakes political contests. These fights introduced strategies that continue to define confirmation battles, influencing their tone, tactics, and outcomes. The precedent</span><span>&nbsp;for blocking lame-duck nominations took shape during the</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;opposition to Fortas&rsquo;s 1968 nomination, justified by LBJ&rsquo;s lame-duck status. Republicans invoked this precedent and successfully blocked President Barack Obama&rsquo;s nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell argued that the next president, to be elected in November 2016, should fill the vacancy, echoing the 1968 GOP stance that &ldquo;the next appointee should be nominated by the new president&rdquo; (NPR, 2016). This blockade kept the seat vacant allowing President Donald Trump to appoint Neil Gorsuch in 2017, cementing a conservative majority on the Court. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>Partisan opposition and ideological vetting </span><span>observed in recent Court confirmation proceedings have their roots in t</span><span class="c1">he Fortas filibuster and the Senate rejections of Haynsworth and Carswell. Brett Kavanaugh&rsquo;s confirmation (50&ndash;48) faced fierce Democratic opposition over his conservative judicial record and allegations of sexual misconduct by Christine Blasey Ford. The hearings, marked by protests and polarized rhetoric, mirrored the aggressive tactics used against Fortas by Senator Thurmond (Bobelian, 2018). Amy Coney Barrett&rsquo;s confirmation (52&ndash;48) was driven by Republican support for her conservative originalist philosophy, with Democrats unable to block her due to Republican control of the Senate. The near-party-line votes in these recent confirmations show how the LBJ and Nixon era&rsquo;s focus on ideology has transformed nominations into ideological litmus tests and widened the partisan divide.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>While used sparingly in subsequent decades, the filibuster&rsquo;s precedent influenced Senate strategies and often yielded desired outcomes. In 2017, Republicans </span><span>eliminated the filibuster</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to confirm Neil Gorsuch with a simple majority after Democrats threatened to block him (NPR, 2016). This change facilitated swift approvals of Kavanaugh and Barrett in a Republican controlled Senate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Warren&rsquo;s contingent resignation in 1968 was intended to secure a liberal successor. But, it failed spectacularly, highlighting the risks of strategic retirements and inspiring future justices to time their departures more carefully. Learning from the failures caused by poorly timing strategic retirements to secure the confirmation during LBJ&rsquo;s administration, retirement decisions taken by justices in recent times are carefully timed to align with presidents who share their ideological leanings, as seen with Justice Kennedy&rsquo;s retirement in 2018, which enabled President Trump to appoint Kavanaugh. The Senate&rsquo;s ability to manipulate the nomination and confirmation outcomes, refined during the 1968 Fortas fight and Nixon&rsquo;s nomination battles, was evident in the delay introduced in Garland&rsquo;s nomination in 2016 and the faster than usual confirmation of Barrett in 2020 Barrett (NPR, 2016). These examples demonstrate how strategic timing by justices and Senate control over the vacancy outcomes have become central to confirmation strategies, intensifying partisan battles over the Court composition.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In conclusion, the Supreme Court nomination processes under Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon shared many similarities, including their politicization, ideological objectives, strong Senate opposition, and the influence of external actors like advocacy groups and the media. However, they differed significantly in political context, nominee selection strategies, opposition tactics, confirmation outcomes, and strategic adaptability, with LBJ&rsquo;s rigid approach contrasting with Nixon&rsquo;s flexibility. The events following Earl Warren&rsquo;s contingent resignation in 1968 led to LBJ&rsquo;s failed nominations of Fortas and Thornberry, Fortas&rsquo;s resignation amid scandal, and Nixon&rsquo;s appointment of four conservative justices effectively shifting the Court from liberal activism to the more restrained Burger Court, with profound effects on criminal justice, civil rights, and judicial philosophy. These battles reshaped institutional norms by introducing filibusters, advocacy campaigns, ethical scrutiny, and strategic retirements, while eroding public trust and deepening partisan divisions. The influence of these fights persists in modern confirmations, from the 2016 Merrick Garland confirmation blockade to the contentious appointments of Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, where lame-duck arguments, ideological vetting, and media amplification echo the tactics of the 1968&ndash;1971 era. The politicization initiated in the LBJ-Nixon era has also fueled recent debates about Court reforms, such as term limits or expanding the number of justices, particularly among Democrats seeking to counter the conservative majority established by Trump&rsquo;s appointments.
