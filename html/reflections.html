It reshaped how I view my place in the world, the power of community, and the quiet courage required to lead with authenticity. What began as an academic exercise evolved into a mirror, reflecting not just societal inequalities but my own unspoken fears and aspirations. Through this process, I discovered that leadership is less about titles or authority and more about the daily choice to show up as your whole self, even when the path feels uncertain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Growing up, I was taught that kindness and collaboration matter more than individual accolades. My parents modeled this through their actions; volunteering at my school, listening intently to friends in crisis, and always stepping up to help when needed. But it was my middle school debate coach, Mrs. Bublitz, who first showed me how these values translate to leadership. As a painfully shy student, I dreaded public speaking. During one particularly nerve-wrecking practice session, I stumbled through a speech, my voice barely audible. Instead of criticizing me, Mrs. Bublitz pulled me aside and said, &ldquo;Your ideas are important. Let&rsquo;s make sure people hear them.&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t stop at encouragement; she became my sponsor, advocating for me when I hesitated to join competitions, rearranging her schedule to coach me one-on-one, and insisting I belonged on stages I was too timid to claim. Years later, this course gave me language for what she&rsquo;d done: sponsorship, not just mentorship. While mentors offer advice, sponsors use their influence to create opportunities. This distinction became a revelation. I realized how vital it is for women, especially introverts like me, to seek out advocates who see their potential even when they doubt it themselves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This lesson collided painfully with the harsh reality of systemic barriers. The course introduced the concept of the &ldquo;broken rung&rdquo; &ndash; the stagnation women face at the first step up the leadership ladder. Data showed that for every 100 men promoted to managerial roles, only 87 women advance. But statistics alone didn&rsquo;t unsettle me as much as recognizing my own complicity in these patterns. I recalled countless times I&rsquo;d diluted my opinions with phrases like &ldquo;I might be wrong, but&hellip;&rdquo; to avoid seeming aggressive. The course named this habit: the confidence gap. Women often wait until they&rsquo;re 100% qualified before seizing opportunities, while men lean into them at 60%. I&rsquo;d internalized this hesitation, waiting for &ldquo;permission&rdquo; to lead rather than choosing to lead. Ruth Bader Ginsburg&rsquo;s story became a beacon here. Despite facing rejection from law firms that refused to hire women, she persisted, using her voice to dismantle systemic sexism one case at a time. Her journey taught me that confidence isn&rsquo;t the absence of fear, it&rsquo;s the resolve to act despite it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This understanding intertwined with my core values: acceptance and confidence. When I was rejected from my dream university, acceptance allowed me to let go of bitterness and embrace the opportunities in front of me. I joined clubs, led projects, and discovered a passion for community service that shaped my career goals. Confidence, meanwhile, pushed me to take risks I once avoided. I&rsquo;ll never forget the visceral anxiety of walking into a job interview for a role I felt underqualified for. My hands trembled, but I repeated a mantra: &ldquo;I can learn. I belong here.&rdquo; I got the job not because I had all the answers, but because I demonstrated a willingness to grow. The course reinforced how these values apply to leadership. Acceptance means fostering environments where people feel safe to be imperfect. Confidence means advocating for yourself and others, even when it&rsquo;s uncomfortable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Leadership, I&rsquo;ve come to realize, isn&rsquo;t forged in spotlight moments but in the quiet, often overlooked spaces between them. As a child, I instinctively understood this. On the playground, I&rsquo;d step into disputes over whose turn it was to kick the red rubber ball, not with authority, but with curiosity. &ldquo;What if we play two rounds and you both get a turn?&rdquo; I&rsquo;d suggest, less a referee than a collaborator. Those small acts of mediation felt natural&mdash;a way to restore harmony without winners or losers. But adolescence reshaped my relationship with leadership. In high school group projects, I&rsquo;d bite my tongue when classmates dismissed my ideas, fearing the label &ldquo;bossy&rdquo; more than the sting of silence. The shift wasn&rsquo;t just about insecurity; it was a survival tactic. I&rsquo;d internalized the unspoken rules: girls who spoke too boldly risked being called &ldquo;difficult,&rdquo; while boys were applauded for the same assertiveness. My younger self&rsquo;s instinct to lead through empathy collided with a world that often conflates loudness with competence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This course reconnected me with the younger version of myself, it enabled me to reclaim her. Studying stalwarts like Angela Merkel, who led Germany through crises with a steady, understated resolve, was revelatory. Here was a leader who wielded power not through grand speeches or charismatic demands, but through meticulous preparation, principled consistency, and an unshakable commitment to her values. Merkel&rsquo;s example dismantled my assumption that leadership required extroversion or aggression. Instead, it showed me that true influence grows from showing up, day after day, even when progress feels invisible. Her quiet resilience mirrored my own childhood approach, and it gave me language for the strength I&rsquo;d mistakenly dismissed as passivity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Reclaiming this mindset hasn&rsquo;t been linear. Early in the course, I volunteered to lead a group discussion, only to spend days agonizing over how to frame my points without seeming &ldquo;too opinionated.&rdquo; My palms sweat as I opened the conversation, but I anchored myself in Merkel&rsquo;s example: leadership isn&rsquo;t about being heard&mdash;it&rsquo;s about ensuring others are understood. I began by asking quieter members, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your take?&rdquo; and built on their responses. The discussion flourished, not because I dominated it, but because I created space for collective insight. That experience taught me that courage isn&rsquo;t the absence of fear but the decision to act alongside it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now, I seek opportunities to lead through authenticity, not performance. I still struggle. Where I once padded my opinions with disclaimers, &ldquo;Sorry, this might be off-topic&hellip;&rdquo;, I now push myself to state them clearly: &ldquo;I have an idea.&rdquo; This shift isn&rsquo;t about arrogance; it&rsquo;s about respecting my own voice enough to let it matter. These small acts are my rebellion against a culture that equates leadership with dominance. They&rsquo;re also my tribute to the women who&rsquo;ve led quietly but powerfully&mdash;not just Merkel, but the teachers who stayed late to nurture students, the colleagues who mentor newcomers without fanfare, and yes, that younger version of myself who just wanted everyone to get a fair turn. I learned that leadership is a practice of tenacity. It&rsquo;s choosing to speak up when every instinct screams to stay quiet, to trust your voice even when it shakes, and to redefine strength not as the absence of doubt, but as the determination to move forward despite it. Every time I do this, I&rsquo;m not just leading, I&rsquo;m honoring the quiet resilience that has always been my birthright.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In the immediate future, my focus is on paying forward the support I&rsquo;ve been privileged to receive. Two years from now, I envision myself mentoring someone who feels as uncertain as I did. Maybe it&rsquo;s a first-year student nervously navigating campus, their backpack slung over one shoulder and a schedule clutched in their hand, wondering if they belong. Or perhaps it&rsquo;s a friend hesitating to launch a podcast or community garden, their idea still half-formed but brimming with potential. I want to be the person who sits down with them, listens to their fears, and contributes to draft a step-by-step plan. Mentorship, to me, means providing both encouragement and practical tools, whether that&rsquo;s sharing resources, connecting them with allies or simply normalizing the messy, nonlinear process of growth. Mrs. Bublitz didn&rsquo;t just believe in me; she handed me a roadmap when I felt lost. I want to do the same for others, not as an expert, but as a fellow traveler who&rsquo;s learned to trust the journey.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As I look further ahead, my aspirations expand beyond individual relationships to systemic change. In five to seven years, I see myself stepping into roles that blend law and community leadership, perhaps managing a team at a nonprofit or advising on policies that address educational disparities. The course underscored how gaps in access &ndash; to quality schools, mental health support or legal advocacy &ndash; are often rooted in structural inequities, not in individual failures. This understanding drives my desire to launch initiatives that tackle these issues at their core. For example, I dream of creating a program that partners law students with underserved high schools, offering free workshops on navigating the college application process. Small actions, I&rsquo;ve learned, can lead up to larger shifts. A single workshop might empower a student to advocate for what they believe in, or inspire them to pursue legal studies themselves. Change doesn&rsquo;t always require grand gestures; sometimes, it&rsquo;s about planting seeds and trusting others to nurture them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Underpinning all these goals is a commitment to always lead with empathy. For me, empathy means designing programs with input from those they&rsquo;re meant to serve. It&rsquo;s the difference between hosting a town hall where community members speak and one where they&rsquo;re truly heard. I want every interaction I facilitate to leave people feeling seen&mdash;whether that&rsquo;s a mentee who finally believes in their potential or a colleague who feels safe sharing an unconventional idea. Years from now, if someone recalls our work together and thinks, &ldquo;She made me feel capable&rdquo;, I consider that as having made an impact. This vision isn&rsquo;t static. It will evolve as I learn, stumble, and adapt. But the core remains: leadership is about creating ripples of agency. Just as Mrs. Bublitz&rsquo;s faith in me altered my trajectory, I hope to help others find their footing, so they, in turn, can lift up those around them. The course didn&rsquo;t just teach me about barriers, it showed me how to build bridges. One conversation, one workshop, one courageous &ldquo;yes&rdquo; at a time. This journey demands daily courage. Recently, during a team meeting, I hesitated to challenge a popular opinion. My heart raced as I imagined being labeled &ldquo;difficult.&rdquo; But then I remembered Malala Yousafzai, who risked her life for girls&rsquo; education, and RBG, who dissented silently but powerfully through her iconic collars. I took a breath and said, &ldquo;I see it differently. Here&rsquo;s why&hellip;&rdquo; My voice shook, but I spoke. I learned progress isn&rsquo;t about erasing fear, it&rsquo;s about choosing to move forward anyway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">This course illuminated systemic barriers, and handed me the tools to dismantle them, not with force, but with deliberate compassion. Before the class, I viewed inequality as an abstract, intractable monolith. Now, I see it as a series of interconnected systems, each shaped by human choices, and therefore malleable to human intervention. This shift from frustration to agency has redefined my understanding of leadership. It&rsquo;s no longer about fighting for a seat at the table; it&rsquo;s about a bold approach to redesign the table to include those who&rsquo;ve been excluded. A pivotal lesson was learning to balance idealism with pragmatism. The course didn&rsquo;t just critique patriarchal structures, it also offered blueprints for subverting them. For instance, we studied organizations that replaced rigid hierarchies with rotating leadership roles, ensuring diverse voices guide decisions. This inspired me to rethink my approach to group projects. Recently, I proposed a &ldquo;collaborative ownership&rdquo; model for a case study team: instead of assigning one leader, we rotated facilitation duties weekly. Initially met with skepticism, the experiment led to quieter members contributing boldly, while those accustomed to dominating learned to listen. It was a microcosm of what institutional change could look like &ndash; small, intentional shifts including everyone leading up to synergistic outcomes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">As someone pursuing law, I&rsquo;d often focused on individual advocacy; defending clients, arguing cases. But studying leaders like Kimberle Crenshaw, who coined the term intersectionality, I realized justice requires more than courtroom wins. It demands addressing the root causes that funnel marginalized groups into legal crises. This lens pushes me to collaborate with communities directly, ensuring solutions are co-created, not imposed. Central to this journey has been the legacy of women who turned obstacles into stepping stones. Mrs. Bublitz&rsquo;s sponsorship taught me that faith in others is a radical act. When she insisted I join that debate competition, she wasn&rsquo;t just nurturing my skills, she was challenging a system that equates quietness with incapability. Similarly, my parents&rsquo; emphasis on kindness over competition laid the groundwork for a leadership style rooted in reciprocity. Their example lives in me when I pause to ask a stressed classmate, &ldquo;How can I support you?&rdquo; rather than rushing to fix their problems. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">The road ahead is indeed uncharted, but the course equipped me with something more reliable than a map: a mindset. Leadership, I now understand, is about stewardship &ndash; the daily practice of tending to people, systems, and values with care. It means listening deeply, not just to respond, but to understand. It&rsquo;s recognizing that progress is rarely linear, and that setbacks, like the time I froze during a keynote speech, are not failures, but feedback. As I step into this next chapter, I carry these lessons not as a shield against doubt, but as a compass. They remind me that leadership isn&rsquo;t a destination, it&rsquo;s the sum of every choice to act with courage, to listen with humility, and to believe, fiercely, in the possibility of a more equitable world. I&rsquo;ll walk it with acceptance, confidence, and the conviction that real leadership isn&rsquo;t about standing alone at the top, it&rsquo;s about ensuring no one is left behind.</span></p></body></html>
